# F13CMS
An advanced CMS aimed at developers to allow complete freedom with pages being coded manually.

## Please note, this project is currently far from production

## Development plans
* Build a bare bones CMS using a simple templating system
* Web pages are created from the template system and requireing a PHP file from within a specific directory
* Each page will consist of a pageName.page.php and a pageName.meta.php
* The menu system will generate a simple multi layer unordered list
* A flat file database will be used to reduce requirements and improve speed due to the reduced loading cycles
* The admin area will provide a simple form for creating and editing pages, alternatively pages may be added via FTP
* The admin area will provide a simple form for editing the website menu and selecting the default page
